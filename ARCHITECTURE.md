# Architecture

The following is a description of the layout of source files for Fluid Earth so
that is possible to find the files in which future changes need to be made.

## Browser entry point

The first file the browser encounters is `dist/index.html`, a blank page with
links to styles and scripts that load the rest of the single-page app (SPA). The
web server root is the `dist/` directory, so a link to `/global.css` in
`dist/index.html` refers to `dist/global.css`.

The contents of `dist/` are generated by the Vite build tool. The
`dist/index.html` file is generated from `index.html`, and static assets are
copied from `public/`. Compilation is controlled by `vite.config.js`.

## `src` directory

The `dist/assets/` styles and scripts are created from the JavaScript and
Svelte files in `src`, with `src/main.js` as the starting point that imports the
rest of the files in the import tree.

Two Svelte components are particularly noteworthy: `src/App.svelte` and
`src/map/Map.svelte`. `App.svelte` defines all the reactive global variables and
their relationships. It also contains all the menus, overlays, and the map.
`Map.svelte` controls all the WebGL logic and displays the map (by default as a
globe) with the props as defined by `App.svelte`.

## `backend` directory

The data and metadata needed to display information on the map is generated by
scripts in the `backend` directory, which output this data and metadata to
`public/tera/` and `public/tera/inventory.json.br`, respectively.
