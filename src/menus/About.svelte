<summary><h2>Previous Version</h2></summary>
<p>
This is the second major iteration of the Fluid Earth project. The previous
version, <a href="https://fever.byrd.osu.edu"> Fluid Earth Viewer</a>, has
weather data from earlier years and climate data that we are still working on
adding to this new version, Fluid Earth. If you need to access this data, or
really liked the previous version's look and feel, click the link above to get

<summary><h2>The Project</h2></summary>
<p>
Fluid Earth is an interactive web application that allows you to visualize
current and past conditions of Earth's atmosphere and oceans.
<p>
You can use Fluid Earth to learn about the atmosphere and oceans by exploring
the daily conditions in places where you live, work, and play or examining whole
regions of the planet over years. In particular, Fluid Earth provides hands-on
visualizations of conditions in polar regions, changes they are undergoing, and
connections between polar regions and the rest of the planet. An open-source
application, Fluid Earth is a vehicle for modern Earth science communication,
making information used by the scientific community accessible and engaging to
everyone. Fluid Earth is explorable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week using your
computer, tablet, or smartphone.
<p>
Our project team is working to remove obstacles to learning about our dynamic
planet, Earth!

<summary><h2>Our Sponsor</h2></summary>
<p>
This project is sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation as an
Exploratory Pathways project under the <a

<summary><h2>The Team</h2></summary>
<p>
The team is comprised of multi-disciplinary researchers and educators from The
Ohio State University committed to improving Earth Science and learning
strategies in diverse education settings.
<p>
Members from OSU's <a href="https://byrd.osu.edu/">Byrd Polar and Climate
Research Center</a> (BPCRC) bring their expertise in education and outreach,
polar weather and climate, and computer information sciences. The team is also
fortunate to have a member from OSU's School of Communication with a wealth of
knowledge on user-testing and the effects and implications of new media
technologies and virtual environments. Together, this team has extensive
experience communicating with public audiences of all ages.

In addition, the team depends on a talented group of undergraduates and Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) students working at The Ohio State
University to assist in designing the user interface, conducting user-testing,
organizing data, and producing tutorials: Bingyu (Sophia) Li, Dingyu Hu, Ruiyang
Chang, Joey Wong, Craig Bossley, Mimi Cai, Adelyn Arens, Devan Agrawal, Daniel
Hamilton, and Shaniqwa Martin.
<p>
Finally, we'd like to thank the following people from the BPCRC for their
technical expertise in support of the project: Tom Kassebaum and Pam Theodotou.
