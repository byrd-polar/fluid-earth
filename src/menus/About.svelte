<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>
Fluid Earth Viewer (FEVer) is an interactive web application that allows you to
visualize current and past conditions of Earth's atmosphere and oceans.
<p>
You can use FEVer to learn about the atmosphere and oceans by exploring the
daily conditions in places where you live, work, and play or examining whole
regions of the planet over years. In particular, FEVer provides hands-on
visualizations of conditions in polar regions, changes they are undergoing, and
connections between polar regions and the rest of the planet. Built on an
open-source application, FEVer is a vehicle for modern Earth science
communication, making information used by the scientific community accessible
and engaging to everyone. FEVer is explorable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
using your computer, tablet, and smartphone.
<p>
Our project team is working to remove obstacles to learning about our dynamic
planet, Earth!
<br><br>

<h2>Our Sponsor</h2>
<p>
This project is sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation as an
Exploratory Pathways project under the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL)
Program.
<br><br>

<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>
The team is comprised of multi-disciplinary researchers and educators from The
Ohio State University committed to improving Earth Science and learning
strategies in diverse education settings.
<p>
Members from OSU's Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center (BPCRC) bring their
expertise in education and outreach, polar weather and climate, and computer
information sciences. The team is also fortunate to have a member from OSU's
School of Communication with a wealth of knowledge on user-testing and the
effects and implications of new media technologies and virtual environments.
Together, this team has extensive experience communicating with public audiences
of all ages.

<p>
In addition, the team depends on a talented group of undergraduates and Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) students working at The Ohio State
University to assist in design of the user interface, conducting of
user-testing, and organization of data: Bingyu (Sophia) Li, Dingyu Hu, Ruiyang
Chang, Joey Wong, Craig Bossley, Michael (Em) Zhan, Mimi Cai, and Adelyn Arens.
Em Zhan is spearheading the reimplementation of FEVer in a WebGL-based
framework.

<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>
FEVer utilizes an enormous amount of scientifically complex data, allowing you
to explore the interconnectedness of weather and climate, including between
polar regions and the rest of the planet.

Data sets include:
<dl>
  <dt>Weather
  <dd>GFS (Global Forecast System)

  <dt>Ocean Currents
  <dd>OSCAR (Ocean Surface Current Analysis Real-time)

  <dt>Sea Surface Temperature
  <dd>RTGSST (Real Time Global Sea Surface Temperature)

  <dt>Aerosols and Chemistry
  <dd>GEOS-5 (Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5)
